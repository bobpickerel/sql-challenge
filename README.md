# sql-challenge

Completed challenge:
	- employee_ERD.pdf and employee_ERD.png show the table layout as modeled in the ERD tool
	- employee-table-create.sql is the create script to build out the database
	- sql-challenge.sql contains the queries to answer the questions specified by the challenge
	- SQL_bonus.ipynb is the jupyter notebook file that answers the bonus questions 
	
Bonus:
	- The data does not look real as you would see in a real company
		- from the histogram - there are far too many salaries in between $40,000 and $41,000.  This appears to make up over 33% of all salaries. Plus there is no salaries below $40,000.
		- from the bar graph - almost all of the positions make the same amount, with the lower sounding titles making more then the senior level.
